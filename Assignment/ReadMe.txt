This file is a description of the the python files in the same directory.

There exists 5 python files.
(1)Lightgbm.py : This file is an implementation of Lightgbm model on the tringing set and generate the results from testint set.
(2)RandomForest.py:This file is an implementation of RandomForest model on the tringing set and generate the results from testint set
(3)Xgboost.pyThis file is an implementation of Xgboost model on the tringing set and generate the results from testint set
(4)ParameterChoosing_rf.py:This file is using greedy search to find the best parameters in randomforest.
(5)ParameterChoosing_xg.py:This file is using greedy search to find the best parameters in xgboost.

And the data file called "train_V2.csv" and "test_V2.csv". You can download these two file from "https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction/data".
You can run the code locally with changing the directory setting in the python file. Or you can just submit the first three python file trough kaggle kernal from "https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction/overview". Just click "late submission" and then copy the code from each file and commit it. Then you submit the output to kaggle and you can see the final result.

Our result is based on mean squared error and each error is shown in the report.
